                    <p>The Nott Tuesday's Tech Start-up of the Year competition is back! We’ve searched for Nottingham's Most Promising Tech Startups, and it's time to decide our winners! We will announce the finalists soon.</p>

            <h3>The prizes</h3>
            <p>Last year we had over £7,500 worth of prizes for the winners including £1000’s of cash prizes. We can't promise anything, but we're looking to source trophies this year on top of those prizes! Jamie (<a href="mailto:jamie@notttuesday.com">jamie@notttuesday.com</a>) is sorting out the prizes this year, so get in touch if you're looking to contribute to the prize pool for this year's awards!</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>The categories</h3>
            <p>Our awards are specifically for technology companies -- this includes startups with web applications, software products, mobile applications and similar IT technology services.</p>

            <p><strong>New Startup of the Year</strong> – This award is for fresh startups who are about to or have just launch their new service / product. The startups can pre-revenue and the emphasis here is on potential. The startups in the category should be less than one year old.</p>

            <p><strong>Emerging Startup of the Year</strong> – This award is for more mature  startups up to 5 years old who have got traction in their market and show further potential.</p>

            <p>The organisers will select which category each application will fall in.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>The format</h3>
            <p>If you're not entering, or are supporting an entrant then simply turn up as you normally would!</p>

            <p>For entrants the evenings format will be simple:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>5 minutes to pitch</li>

            <li>Judges retire to deliberate</li>
            <li>Winner announced &amp; prizes given</li>
            </ul>

            <p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Nott-Tuesday-Getting-Nottinghams-tech-scene-together/events/206139632/">RSVP to the event on Meetup here and let us know you're coming!</a></p>

            <hr>

            <h3>The panel</h3>
            <p>The judging panel will include experts in entrepreneurship, funding and legal advice. We’ll let you know who they are once all the judges have confirmed.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>The pitch</h3>
            <p>The judges are going to want to hear about:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Business overview</li>
            <li>Market information i.e. opportunity and competition</li>
            <li>Management team</li>
            <li>Key achievements</li>
            <li>Growth strategy (management needed, investment &amp; exit strategy)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The trick is to keep the application and pitch concise and punchy.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>The judging</h3>

            <p>Finalist selection - an pre-assessment of the business and opportunity on all entries will be made by the judges.
