# Nott Tuesday website and event assets

This repository holds the source code for http://www.notttuesday.com/ which is maintained internally by Jamie Huskisson ([@jhuskisson](https://twitter.com/jhuskisson)) and the design team at [JH](http://wearejh.com) on behalf of the Tech Startup community in Nottingham.

In addition to the website and all files related to it this repository contains all event assets:
* branding source files
* drink tokens source files
* slides templates used during each event
* keynote templates for presentations used by the event
* tv display ad source files used to promote the event
* twitter/meetup profile branding source files

We've made all this open source for anyone to use however they see fit, providing it's not for profit.

If you do use any of these files in any way we'd love to hear about it, just get in touch!
